	I study at the National University of Mongolia, the oldest and prestigious university in the country, majoring in Software engineering.
	I enjoy experimenting many different things and gaining diverse experience, but there are several hobbies and interests 
	that I usually find myself enjoying doing them.
	Even though, reading, various group activities, working out , playing video games, and coding are the things 
	i like doing in my leisure time, among them, my favorite activity is sports, specifically basketball.
	it is very important to me to maintain my health.
	In terms of my previous work experience, I worked in a convinience store, named GS25, 
	while I was studying in this Autumn. During the two months that i worked there, i was working as a cashier, fast food preparer and cleaner 
	depending on the services that i needed to serve to costumers. This experience of working in a convenience4 store was truly valuable for me 
	that I developed strong communication skill and excellent multitasking ability along with improving my management as well.
	Finally, i genuinely wanna visit America through this program, 
	because it provides me with a chance to spend the time there, 
	keeping a balance between earning money through work and having fun while traveling.
